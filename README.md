# sf-cross-cutting-concerns
Cross cutting concerns for apex code. However, going found I will upkeep via the DX project; which can be found :star2: [here](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-accc-dx) :star2:

See this highlevel [blog](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2018/10/configuration-first-replacing-code-at-runtime.html) on this framework.

This code designed to encapsulate common cross-cutting concerns (logging, exception handling, **platform events**, caching, etc.).Often times cross-cutting concerns are an after-thought; or, hastily injected without any ability to manage or control.This package encapsulates those concerns and provide a mechanism to change/augment. 
Changing behaviour is a matter of inheritance and specifying choice via custom metadata. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-cross-cutting-concerns/wiki) for more information.

## :star2: Updates - Incorporated [Platform Events](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-platform-events) Consumer/Publisher
Platform Events has been incorporated into this framework  (:point_right:**merge-pe** branch) . The overlap between the two was too much to ignore.

It now includes a section on [Platform Events](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-cross-cutting-concerns/wiki/Platform-Events). The work is on-going and will be addressed in conjunction with requests. Currently, the updates for Platform Events includes:
* Added Summer '19 features _AsyncOperationEvent_; however, this will tie this the package (merge-pe branch) to minimum version 46.
* Updates include more data written into the BigObject (i.e. replayids and operation ids) for recovery on a queued high-volume event.
* The template will be started but will probably not be done before the merge.
* Incorporate Trigger Handling for Platform Events and CDC. There is a section that can tie in the [trigger handling framework](https://github.com/bjanderson70/sf-trigger-handling/wiki)
* Control Event Batching Size (initially via attributes before moving into CMDT)

## Caveat
This package utilities a good deal of Object Oriented Principles (OOP) (as outlined in the blog linked). This [site](http://ootips.org/) provides information around OOP and elements therein. Without having a good Object Oriented base, you may be able to take advantage of the components within the package, but you will not fully realize the underlying benefits/intent.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Platform Cache enable; otherwise, caching WILL NOT work. Please note, if you are developing in a **Dev Org**, there is no caching and those **related unit tests will fail**. In addition, tests will fail if email deliverability is disabled.

## Running the tests

The unit tests have a minimum of 90% code coverage. Tests can be invoked from favortite case tool.
In Salesforce Org, navigate to **Setup->Apex Classes** and run all tests

### And coding style tests

All code, files and objects related to Apex Cross-Cutting Concerns are prefixed with 'accc'

## Deployment

There are **TWO** repos now. One is the older version which does not have the Platform Events. The newer one incorporates Platform Events and Change Data Capture (CDC) into the cross-cutting concerns.

Use the button below to install the **ALL version** (i.e. with Platform Events + Trigger Handler)

## Apex Docs
If you download **CCCDocs** directory and navigate to _ApexDocumentation_ directory and bring up _index.htm_ in the browser you will get the JavaDoc-like information. The documentation will also link to the Wiki
